            <p>buying notes has the convenience factor. Rather than spending hours taking detailed and organized notes,
                you can purchase notes that have already been created by experienced note-takers. This can be
                particularly appealing for students who
                struggle to keep up with fast-paced lectures
                along with time savings, buying notes can also provide you with access to valuable insights and
                information that you may have missed during class.
                We may include additional resources such as outlines and summaries, </p>
